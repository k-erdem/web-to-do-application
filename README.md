# To-Do List Application üöÄ ‚úÖ

_A small but mighty web-based To-Do List application._

Built using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. Allows users to delightfully create, read, update, and delete tasks.

I built a simple web app to sharpen my full-stack skills, transitioning to the PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js (PERN) stack. This project allowed me to refine my backend API development, coding practices, and front-end skills.

Next, I plan to enhance the project with features like unit testing, authentication methods, and more complex queries, showcasing my full-stack capabilities. I invite you to explore my mini-project and welcome any feedback! For more projects, please visit my GitHub profile at [k-erdem](https://github.com/k-erdem).

## Features

- Create new tasks with a description.
- View a list of all tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Next on the Agenda: üîç

- **Implement user authentication & log-in/log-out with JWT**: Enhance security and user experience by adding authentication features using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **Enhance individual to-do items with due date and assignee features**: Provide users with more customization options for their tasks, improving task management efficiency.

- **Deploy the application to the cloud**: Allow users to use the application from anywhere, without needing a running local server.
